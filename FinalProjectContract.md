# Final Project Contract

### Communication

**Team Meetings:** Team will meet at least once every week. Meeting times will be coordinated by the group members such that all members may attend. Meetings may occur more frequently than described here. Projected meeting time is Saturday 3PM. 

**Assistance:** Team will communicate via email, discord and zoom meetings if necessary. Team members will strive to reply within 48 hours. 

**Respect:** On decisions by the group, all group members will be given a chance to state their opinion. Decisions will be made by a simple majority of the group. By signing this contract, every team member commits to abide by decisions made by the group.

### Collaboration 

**Work Distribution:** Team members will volunteer for which aspects they work on. If no member volunteers, random assignments will be made. If division of work becomes uneven, other members will pick up parts of the larger portion of work. 

**Time Commitment:** Members are expected to spend 2 hours a week at minimum working on the project, and are not expected to exceed 6 hours. In the case that deliverables are on track to be late, other members may be brought in to ensure that deadlines are met. If consistent issues prop up with members completing work, the team will discuss the issues within the group to understand the source of the issue.

**Conflict Resolution:** In the event of conflict, such matters will be discussed in a group meeting. Members will decide appropriate action by a simple majority. In the event that one party disagrees with the groupâ€™s decision, such matters may then be discussed with the course staff.
